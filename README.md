## Abstract
  Intention timer is an application that allows a user to set goals for their health and productivity in a set amount of time. Users will select an activity           category, set the amount of time they want to spend on that activity, and start the timer. The timer will count-down from the amount of time set to zero.  The app   will then log that activity in a card that will allow the user to view their past activities. Past activities will persist upon page load (because they are set in   local storage).
