## Abstract
  Intention timer is an application that allows a user to set goals for their health and productivity in a set amount of time. Users will select an activity           category, set the amount of time they want to spend on that activity, and start the timer. The timer will count-down from the amount of time set to zero.  The app   will then log that activity in a card that will allow the user to view their past activities. Past activities will persist upon page load (because they are set in   local storage).  

## Technologies

## Wins
  - We were successful in creating CSS that matched the comp of the project.  
  - Our local storage persisted upon page load.  

## Challenges + Improvements
  - The countdown timer was the biggest challenge for our group.  
  - We had a bug where the user was able to input 0 + seconds and 00(seconds input) would appear on the timer.  
  - If we had more time, we would want to combine the toggleButton functions into one function.
